* Chinese translation

* clean up footer content

DONE
====

* navigation menu doesn't disappear automatically after selected (on mobile)
* JS of navigation bar is broken
* under "nominate" is it possible to add a checkbox for "I nominate myself" that fills in the person's info if they've entered it already?
* on the second signup form ("tell us more..") I intended the first "languages spoken" to be checkboxes of major languages (allLanguages). And then the "other languages" would be where people enter e.g. Amharic or SiSwati. If that's not practical, then let's remove "languagesSpoken" and just have "other Languages" as a text field.
